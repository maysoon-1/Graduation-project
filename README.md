## ABSTRACT
Rehabilitation programs are vital for the people that suffer injuries, The 
Covid-19 pandemic made it impossible for these people to follow such 
programs at healthcare centers, This study aims to develop a new solution 
for patients opting instead for a Rehabilitation in the Home RITH, Include a 
range of exercises and activities that can be easily performed at home, 
The ultimate goal of the project is to improve access to rehabilitation 
services and the project has the potential to make a significant impact on 
the field of rehabilitation medicine and to improve the lives of individuals 
with physical problems and their families.
## Background
Using a camera-enabled system, we've created a module designed to 
assist individuals undergoing physiotherapy. This module provides 
prescribed exercises and aids in monitoring the execution of these 
exercises to ensure their accuracy. This tool serves as a supportive 
mechanism for patients, allowing them to engage in their prescribed 
physiotherapy routines with enhanced guidance and feedback, following 
consultations with their physiotherapists.
## Problem overview
Difficulty in providing the cost of physiotherapy, especially for patients who 
need long- term treatment, some patients cannot go to the physiotherapy 
clinic due to lack of transportation. People who are unable to move as a 
result of a medical condition. Some patients live far from physical therapy 
clinics.
## Aims and Objectives
Aim of this project is to develop a remote rehabilitation physiotherapy 
program that includes exercises and activities tailored to the specific 
needs of patients that will allow each affected patient to get the necessary 
rehabilitation, And the most important thing is to reduce healthcare costs 
by providing more cost-effective solutions for patients and the effort for 
healthcare providers.
## Objectives
1-create a user-friendly remote physiotherapy platform that allows patients 
to access physiotherapy services from their homes.
2-provide accessible and convenient physical therapy services to patients 
who may have difficulty accessing in-person care, such as those who live 
in remote areas, have mobility limitations.
3-Ensure that the patient is performing the exercises correctly by providing 
direct feedback Messages.
